In prolog, all data are represented by Prolog "terms".
What are terms?
    - an atom is a term
    - a variable is a term
    - integers and floating point numbers are terms
    - a compound term is a term, defined inductiely as follows:
        if T1, T2, ..., Tn are terms, then F(T1, T2, ..., Tn) is also a term,
        where F is called the "functor" of the compound term, and "n" is
        called the arity
